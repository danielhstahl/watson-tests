          "text": "The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together. Concretely, you are given a training set {x(1), ..., x(m)} (where x(i) ∈ Rn), and want to group the data into a few cohesive \"clusters\". The intuition behind K-means is an iterative procedure that starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then refines this guess by repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids and then recomputing the centroids based on the assignments. The K-means algorithm is as follows: % Initialize centroids centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K); for iter = 1:iterations % Cluster assignment step: Assign each data point to the % closest centroid. idx(i) corresponds to cˆ(i), the index % of the centroid assigned to example i idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids); % Move centroid step: Compute means based on centroid % assignments centroids = computeMeans(X, idx, K); end The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: (i) Assigning each training example x(i) to its closest centroid, and (ii) Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. The K-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. Note that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids. Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion). You will implement the two phases of the K-means algorithm separately in the next sections. 1.1.1 Finding closest centroids In the \"cluster assignment\" phase of the K-means algorithm, the algorithm assigns every training example x(i) to its closest centroid, given the current positions of centroids. Specifically, for every example i we set c(i) := j that minimizes ||x(i) − µj||2, where c(i) is the index of the centroid that is closest to x(i), and µj is the position (value) of the j'th centroid. Note that c(i) corresponds to idx(i) in the starter code. Your task is to complete the code in findClosestCentroids.m. This function takes the data matrix X and the locations of all centroids inside centroids and should output a one-dimensional array idx that holds the index (a value in {1, ..., K}, where K is total number of centroids) of the closest centroid to every training example. You can implement this using a loop over every training example and every centroid. Once you have completed the code in findClosestCentroids.m, the script ex7.m will run your code and you should see the output [1 3 2] corresponding to the centroid assignments for the first 3 examples. You should now submit your solutions. 1.1.2 Computing centroid means Given assignments of every point to a centroid, the second phase of the algorithm recomputes, for each centroid, the mean of the points that were assigned to it. Specifically, for every centroid k we set µk := 1 |Ck| ∑ i∈Ck x(i) where Ck is the set of examples that are assigned to centroid k. Concretely, if two examples say x(3) and x(5) are assigned to centroid k = 2, then you should update µ2 = 1 2 (x(3) + x(5)). You should now complete the code in computeCentroids.m. You can implement this function using a loop over the centroids. You can also use a loop over the examples; but if you can use a vectorized implementation that does not use such a loop, your code may run faster. Once you have completed the code in computeCentroids.m, the script ex7.m will run your code and output the centroids after the first step of K-means. You should now submit your solutions."

This encoding is often refered to as the RGB encoding. Our image contains thousands of colors, and in this part of the exercise, you will reduce the number of colors to 16 colors. By making this reduction, it is possible to represent (compress) the photo in an efficient way. Specifically, you only need to store the RGB values of the 16 selected colors, and for each pixel in the image you now need to only store the index of the color at that location (where only 4 bits are necessary to represent 16 possibilities). In this exercise, you will use the K-means algorithm to select the 16 colors that will be used to represent the compressed image. Concretely, you will treat every pixel in the original image as a data example and use the K-means algorithm to find the 16 colors that best group (cluster) the pixels in the 3-dimensional RGB space. Once you have computed the cluster centroids on the image, you will then use the 16 colors to replace the pixels in the original image. 1.4.1 K-means on pixels In Octave/MATLAB, images can be read in as follows: % Load 128x128 color image (bird small.png) A = imread('bird small.png'); % You will need to have installed the image package to used % imread. If you do not have the image package installed, you % should instead change the following line to % % load('bird small.mat'); % Loads the image into the variable A This creates a three-dimensional matrix A whose first two indices identify a pixel position and whose last index represents red, green, or blue. For example, A(50, 33, 3) gives the blue intensity of the pixel at row 50 and column 33. The code inside ex7.m first loads the image, and then reshapes it to create an m × 3 matrix of pixel colors (where m = 16384 = 128 × 128), and calls your K-means function on it. After finding the top K = 16 colors to represent the image, you can now 2The provided photo used in this exercise belongs to Frank Wouters and is used with his permission. assign each pixel position to its closest centroid using the findClosestCentroids function. This allows you to represent the original image using the centroid assignments of each pixel. Notice that you have significantly reduced the number of bits that are required to describe the image. The original image required 24 bits for each one of the 128×128 pixel locations, resulting in total size of 128× 128× 24 = 393, 216 bits. The new representation requires some overhead storage in form of a dictionary of 16 colors, each of which require 24 bits, but the image itself then only requires 4 bits per pixel location. The final number of bits used is therefore 16× 24 + 128× 128× 4 = 65, 920 bits, which corresponds to compressing the original image by about a factor of 6. 1 Figure 3: Original and reconstructed image (when using K-means to compress the image). Finally, you can view the effects of the compression by reconstructing the image based only on the centroid assignments. Specifically, you can replace each pixel location with the mean of the centroid assigned to it. Figure 3 shows the reconstruction we obtained. Even though the resulting image retains most of the characteristics of the original, we also see some compression artifacts. You do not need to make any submissions for this part of the exercise."

In practice, if you were using a learning algorithm such as linear regression or perhaps neural networks, you could now use the projected data instead of the original data.

This allows you to use your learning algorithm with a smaller input size (e.g., 100 dimensions) instead of the original 1024 dimensions. This can help speed up your learning algorithm. Figure 8: Principal components on the face dataset Figure 9: Original images of faces and ones reconstructed from only the top 100 principal components. The next part in ex7 pca.m will project the face dataset onto only the first 100 principal components. Concretely, each face image is now described by a vector z(i) ∈ R100. To understand what is lost in the dimension reduction, you can recover the data using only the projected dataset. In ex7 pca.m, an approximate recovery of the data is performed and the original and projected face images are displayed side by side (Figure 9). From the reconstruction, you can observe that the general structure and appearance of the face are kept while the fine details are lost. This is a remarkable reduction (more than 10×) in the dataset size that can help speed up your learning algorithm significantly. For example, if you were training a neural network to perform person recognition (gven a face image, predict the identitfy of the person), you can use the dimension reduced input of only a 100 dimensions instead of the original pixels."

In the last part of the ex7 pca.m script, we have provided code to visualize the final pixel assignments in this 3D space using the scatter3 function. Each data point is colored according to the cluster it has been assigned to. You can drag your mouse on the figure to rotate and inspect this data in 3 dimensions. It turns out that visualizing datasets in 3 dimensions or greater can be cumbersome. Therefore, it is often desirable to only display the data in 2D even at the cost of losing some information. In practice, PCA is often used to reduce the dimensionality of data for visualization purposes. In the next part of ex7 pca.m, the script will apply your implementation of PCA to the 3-dimensional data to reduce it to 2 dimensions and visualize the result in a 2D scatter plot. The PCA projection can be thought of as a rotation that selects the view that maximizes the spread of the data, which often corresponds to the \"best\" view.
